%WEIGHTS_BILINEAR_EXCEPT_DISOCCLUSIONS  Computes weights for bilinear
%interpolation inside quads, distinguishing pixels in disoccluded areas and
%disregarding the occluder.
%
%   Inputs:
%
%       |pixel_grid|: M-by-2 matrix containing pixel positions in its rows.
%
%       |mesh_vertices|: N-by-2 matrix holding locations of warped pixels of
%       original image
%
%       |quads|: l-by-4 matrix, each row of which contains the indices of the
%       pixels that form a quad
%
%       |quad_assignments|: 1-by-M cell array containing the assigned quad for
%       each pixel of the |pixel_grid|, if any assignment has been performed.
%
%       |depth|: N-by-1 vector with depth values for mesh vertices.
%
%   Output:
%       |w_bilinear|: 1-by-M cell array, where each cell contains the
%       interpolation weights for the respective pixel.
